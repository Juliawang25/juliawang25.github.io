<p class="review" > 4/5 Ben and jerrys contains many flavors,it is many peoples all time favorite ice cream stores even to late night show jimmy fallon, who ben and jerrys named an flavor to. although being tasty and sweet ben and jerrys may not be the healthiest brand with almost up to 400 calories per pint! </p>

<p class="review"> good, 5 out of 5 stars best tasting ice cream you can buy! Haagen daaz is the BENCHMARK standard by which all other ice creams are judged. from the all natural ingredients and no artificial preservatives or emulsifiers or additives to the simple pure ingredients in each pint, the flavors just wow me!</p>

<p class = "review" > 3/5 bad stars While Blue Bell Creameries' ice cream as a whole isn't unhealthy, one particular flavor stands out among the rest: Pecan Pralines 'n Cream. Why? Not only is it one of the most caloric pints of ice cream the brand produces, but it also contains an alarming 81 grams of sugar.</p>
